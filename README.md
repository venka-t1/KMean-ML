K-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, partitions data into k clusters based on similarity. Utilized with the Iris dataset, featuring iris flower measurements, K-means aims to minimize intra-cluster variance by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid. This algorithm's effectiveness depends on the choice of k and initial centroids. Common applications include market segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection. However, it assumes clusters with similar variance and density, which might not always align with real-world data distributions
